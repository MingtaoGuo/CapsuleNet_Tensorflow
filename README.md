# CapsuleNet_Tensorflow
The code of CapsuleNet

Capsule is a new Neural in Artificial Neural Network.General Neural like in CNN,for every Neural is scalar in scalar out,but in Capsule is not,It is vector in vector out.I think its expending is interesting,and it has a good performance on MNIST and SMALLNorb.Please see the detail in this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829
